# Accredible API Documentation

Overview
--------
The Accredible platform lets you automatically create, manage, and distribute digital certificates, open badges and blockchain credentials.

Digital certificates and badges help maximize the value from your training or certification program. Digital credentials are more accessible and share-able via social media, directing interested viewers back towards your learners’achievements and your course website. Track recipient engagement to see shares, additional traffic to your webpage. And, allow students to save and print a PDF for their wall at home.

This documentation defines the objects, endpoints and interfaces for the Accredible RESTful API.

The live REST API documentation can be found here: http://docs.accrediblecredentialapi.apiary.io/
