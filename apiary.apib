# Accredible Credential API
The [Accredible](https://www.accredible.com/) Credential API allows you to create and interact with badges and certificates called [Accredible Credentials](https://www.credential.net/10000005).

There are 3 main objects in Accredible: Credentials, Groups and Designs.

[![API Overview Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/R7euTeMGaQg/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7euTeMGaQg)

# Credentials
[Credentials](http://docs.accrediblecredentialapi.apiary.io/#reference/credentials) are the core object in the API. They collect all of the data related to a course, training acitivity or achievment and the recipient/participant information.

You should create a credential for each achievement completion that a recipient has. For example if John Doe finishes the Programming 101 course we should create one credential to represent that. If John Doe achieves something else then he would need a new credential.

# Groups
[Groups](http://docs.accrediblecredentialapi.apiary.io/#reference/groups) are similar to a folder or a course. They contain information about the achievement and have multiple Credentials attached to them.

For example you should create a group for the Introduction to Programming course. You'd provide the Course Name, Course Descripion and Course URL. In the future you can pass the name or ID of this group when creating a credential so that the credential is passed all the information relating to the achievement.

# Designs
[Designs](http://docs.accrediblecredentialapi.apiary.io/#reference/designs) provide a visual specification for how a Credential should be rendered. Design can be used accross multiple Groups.

For example if we have three courses: Intro to Basic Programming, Intro to Advanced Programming and Intro to DevOps each of these may have the same design for their Credentials. When creating or updating their corresponding Groups you would attach the desired design accordingly.

# Departments
[Departments](http://docs.accrediblecredentialapi.apiary.io/#reference/departments), if enabled for your account allow you to manage multiple, independent organization groups. Each Department is entirely separate with it's own Designs, Groups, Branding, etc. You cannot share data between Departments excepting Billing and Administrators.

# Attributes
[Attributes](http://docs.accrediblecredentialapi.apiary.io/#reference/attributes), are used to merge information with your certificate designs and email templates. Attributes acts as as placeholders for information and can be added to certificate designs and email templates.

# Issuers
[Issuers](http://docs.accrediblecredentialapi.apiary.io/#reference/issuer) provide organization details.

# API Key
API keys are used as Authorization tokens in the header in all authenticated API endpoints. These Keys are managed in the [Accredible Dashboard](https://dashboard.accredible.com/). There are two types of API Keys, those that are account wide and work on all assets and those that are related to a specific department. API keys scoped to a specific department can only access the resources (Credentials, Groups, Designs etc.) belonging to that department.

# Single sign-on options on Accredible
[Single sign-on](http://docs.accrediblecredentialapi.apiary.io/#reference/sso) in addition to the student authentication provided by Accredible, you can also use single sign-on to authenticate your student into Accredible and they can directly sign-in.

SSO is also available via our Integrations and via SAML 2.0.

# Rate Limiting
We allow up to 200 requests every 30 seconds from a single IP address. If you attempt to make requests more quickly then this you may receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response from an endpoint.

# Errors
Accredible uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. Codes in the 2xx range indicate success in general and codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a permissions error, etc). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with Accredible.

Summary of response codes:

| Response Code | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 200 | The request was successful. |
| 401 | Invalid API key. |
| 403 | Permissions error. You do not have access to the requested resource. |
| 404 | The request used a resource that could not be found. |
| 429 | Too many requests. Please see the Rate Limiting section. |
| 500 | Accredible Internal Error. |



#Group Quick Start
In this quick start tutorial, we assume you have already created your first group. If you haven't then go to [create a group in the dashboard](https://dashboard.accredible.com/issuer/dashboard/group/new?edit=information-and-appearance) or use [this API request](https://accrediblecredentialapi.docs.apiary.io/reference/groups/groups/create-a-group).

To get you up and running the example below shows you how to create a basic Credential.

### Credentials [/v1/credentials]

                "meta_data": null
            }
        }

# Group Credentials
Credentials are the core object in Accredible. They collect all of the data related to a course/training/achievment and a recipient.

You should create a credential for each achievement completion that a recipient has. For example if John Doe finishes the Programming 101 course we should create one credential to represent that. If John Doe achieves something else then he would need a new credential.

By default a Group doesn't allow duplicate credentials to be issued to the same recipient. You can update this setting if you would like to do so: https://help.accredible.com/can-i-allow-duplicate-credentials-in-a-group

## Credentials [/v1/credentials]

#### Create a New Credential [POST]

You create a Credential with optional EvidenceItems and References using this action. Please make sure that you've created a group on your dashboard before creating a Credential. If you haven't then [create a group in the dashboard](https://dashboard.accredible.com/issuer/dashboard/group/new?edit=information-and-appearance) or use [this API request](https://accrediblecredentialapi.docs.apiary.io/reference/groups/groups/create-a-group).

This endpoint requires a JSON object containing a Credential.

+ Request (application/json)

    + Headers

            Authorization: Token token=YOUR API_KEY

    + Attributes
        + id (string, optional) - The unique ID of the credential. If you supply your own internal ID we'll use this as a reference for the Credential. If not we'll assign an ID.
        + recipient.name (string, required) - The name of the recipient the credential is issued to.
        + recipient.email (string, required) - The recipient's email address.
        + recipient.id (string, optional) - The recipient's user ID as defined by your organization. This alllows you to easily map your recipients to their Credentials regardless of changes to their email address.
        + recipient.meta_data(object, optional) - You can use this parameter to attach key-value strings to the object. Meta data is useful for storing additional, structured information on an object.
        + group_id (number, required) -  Group Id to which the credential should belong. Legacy field. Group name may be used in place of a Group ID.
        + name (string, optional) - The Credential/course name displayed to recipients. This is required if the Group the Credential belongs to doesn't have a Course Name set.
        + description (string, optional) - The credential/course description displayed to recipients. This is required if the Group the Credential belongs to doesn't have a Course Description set.
        + custom_attributes (object, optional) - Custom variables to display on the Credential. These should be added to the design using the visual editor. Data should be formatted as a JSON hash where keys are the custom attribute names and the values are the values to be displayed on the Credential.
        + issued_on (string, optional) - Date of issue, the default is when the credential is created. Format: DD/MM/YYYY
        + expired_on (string, optional) - Date you would like the credential to expire on, null by default. Format: DD/MM/YYYY
        + complete (boolean, optional) - Whether the achievement is complete or still in progress, true by default.
        + private (boolean, optional) - Whether to make credential private, will require a secret key to open it. If set to true, by default false.
        + approve (boolean, optional) - Whether to publish credential at the time of creation. By default this is true but settings at dashboard for sandbox_mode take precendence.
        + allow_supplemental_evidence (boolean, optional) - Whether to allow recipients to add their own supplemental evidence to the Credential, true by default.
        + allow_supplemental_references (boolean, optional) - Whether to allow recipients to add their own supplemental references to the credential, true by default.
        + evidence_items (array, optional) - Evidence to add to this credential, that provide more information about how the recipient met the achievement. See http://docs.accrediblecredentialapi.apiary.io/#reference/evidence-items/evidence-item/create-a-new-evidence-item for fields. Typically this would include work samples for a course.
        + references (array, optional) - References to add to this Credential, that provide more information about how the recipient met the achievement. see http://docs.accrediblecredentialapi.apiary.io/#reference/references/reference/create-a-new-reference for fields. Typically this would be a peer, teacher or manager giving their feedback.
        + meta_data (object, optional) - You can use this parameter to attach key-value strings to the object. Meta data is useful for storing additional, structured information on an object.

# Group Groups
Groups are similar to a course or a folder of Credentials. They contain information about the achievement and have multiple Credentials attached to them.

For example you should create a group for the Introduction to Programming course. You'd provide the Course Name, Course Descripion and Course URL. In the future you can pass the name or ID of this group when creating a credential so that the credential is passed all the information relating to the achievement.

# Group Designs

## Designs [/v1/designs{?kind}{?department_id}]
Designs provide a visual specification for how a Credential should be rendered. Design can be used accross multiple Groups.

For example if we have three courses: Intro to Basic Programming, Intro to Advanced Programming and Intro to DevOps each of these may have the same design for their Credentials. When creating or updating their corresponding Groups you would attach the desired design accordingly.

# Group SSO

Accredible offers single sign-on solutions for recipients and issuers. Email support@accredible.com for a full list of options and to receive development assistance. SSO is also available via our Integrations and via SAML 2.0.

## Recipient SSO Link [/v1/sso/generate_link]
The easiest way to provide single sign-on for your recipients is to generate a link at render time. We recommend:<br>
a) Add a button on your platform for recipients to go to their credential(s).<br>
b) When the user clicks the button, make request to the below endpoint to generate a link.<br>
c) Redirect the user to the link provided in the response.<br>


### Generating Link [POST]
