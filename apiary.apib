# Accredible Credential API
The [Accredible](https://www.accredible.com/) Credential API allows you to create and interact with badges and certificates called [Accredible Credentials](https://www.credential.net/10000005).

There are 3 main objects in Accredible: Credentials, Groups and Designs.

[![API Overview Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/R7euTeMGaQg/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7euTeMGaQg)

# Credentials
[Credentials](http://docs.accrediblecredentialapi.apiary.io/#reference/credentials) are the core object in the API. They collect all of the data related to a course, training acitivity or achievment and the recipient/participant information.

You should create a credential for each achievement completion that a recipient has. For example if John Doe finishes the Programming 101 course we should create one credential to represent that. If John Doe achieves something else then he would need a new credential.

# Groups
[Groups](http://docs.accrediblecredentialapi.apiary.io/#reference/groups) are similar to a folder or a course. They contain information about the achievement and have multiple Credentials attached to them.

For example you should create a group for the Introduction to Programming course. You'd provide the Course Name, Course Descripion and Course URL. In the future you can pass the name or ID of this group when creating a credential so that the credential is passed all the information relating to the achievement.

# Designs
[Designs](http://docs.accrediblecredentialapi.apiary.io/#reference/designs) provide a visual specification for how a Credential should be rendered. Design can be used accross multiple Groups.

For example if we have three courses: Intro to Basic Programming, Intro to Advanced Programming and Intro to DevOps each of these may have the same design for their Credentials. When creating or updating their corresponding Groups you would attach the desired design accordingly.

# Issuers
[Issuers](http://docs.accrediblecredentialapi.apiary.io/#reference/issuer) provide organization details.

# Single sign-on options on Accredible
[Single sign-on](http://docs.accrediblecredentialapi.apiary.io/#reference/sso) in addition to the student authentication provided by Accredible, you can also use single sign-on to authenticate your student into Accredible and they can directly sign-in.

SSO is also available via our Integrations and via SAML 2.0.

# Rate Limiting
We allow up to 100 requests every 10 seconds from a single IP address. If you attempt to make requests more quickly then this you may receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response from an endpoint.

#Group Quick Start
In this quick start tutorial, we assume you have already created your first group. If you haven't then go to [create a group in the dashboard](https://dashboard.accredible.com/issuer/dashboard/group/new?edit=information-and-appearance) or use [this API request](https://accrediblecredentialapi.docs.apiary.io/reference/groups/groups/create-a-group).

To get you up and running the example below shows you how to create a basic Credential.

### Credentials [/v1/credentials]

                    "group_id": 34
                }
            }


+ Response 200 (application/json)

        {

                }
            }
        }

# Group Credentials
Credentials are the core object in Accredible. They collect all of the data related to a course/training/achievment and a recipient.

You should create a credential for each achievement completion that a recipient has. For example if John Doe finishes the Programming 101 course we should create one credential to represent that. If John Doe achieves something else then he would need a new credential.

By default a Group doesn't allow duplicate credentials to be issued to the same recipient. You can update this setting if you would like to do so: https://help.accredible.com/can-i-allow-duplicate-credentials-in-a-group

## Credentials [/v1/credentials]

#### Create a New Credential [POST]

You create a Credential with optional EvidenceItems and References using this action. Please make sure that you've created a group on your dashboard before creating a Credential. If you haven't then [create a group in the dashboard](https://dashboard.accredible.com/issuer/dashboard/group/new?edit=information-and-appearance) or use [this API request](https://accrediblecredentialapi.docs.apiary.io/reference/groups/groups/create-a-group).

This endpoint requires a JSON object containing a Credential.

+ Request (application/json)

    + Headers

            Authorization: Token token=YOUR API_KEY

    + Attributes
        + id (string, optional) - The unique ID of the credential. If you supply your own internal ID we'll use this as a reference for the Credential. If not we'll assign an ID.
        + recipient.name (string, required) - The name of the recipient the credential is issued to.
        + recipient.email (string, required) - The recipient's email address.
        + recipient.id (string, optional) - The recipient's user ID as defined by your organization. This alllows you to easily map your recipients to their Credentials regardless of changes to their email address.
        + group_id (number, required) -  Group Id to which the credential should belong. Legacy field. Group name may be used in place of a Group ID.
        + name (string, optional) - The Credential/course name displayed to recipients. This is required if the Group the Credential belongs to doesn't have a Course Name set.
        + description (string, optional) - The credential/course description displayed to recipients. This is required if the Group the Credential belongs to doesn't have a Course Description set.
        + custom_attributes (object, optional) - Custom variables to display on the Credential. These should be added to the design using the visual editor. Data should be formatted as a JSON hash where keys are the custom attribute names and the values are the values to be displayed on the Credential.
        + issued_on (string, optional) - Date of issue, the default is when the credential is created.
        + expired_on (string, optional) - Date you would like the credential to expire on, null by default.
        + complete (boolean, optional) - Whether the achievement is complete or still in progress, true by default.
        + private (boolean, optional) - Whether to make credential private, will require a secret key to open it. If set to true, by default false.
        + approve (boolean, optional) - Whether to publish credential at the time of creation. By default this is true but settings at dashboard for sandbox_mode take precendence.
        + allow_supplemental_evidence (boolean, optional) - Whether to allow recipients to add their own supplemental evidence to the Credential, true by default.
        + allow_supplemental_references (boolean, optional) - Whether to allow recipients to add their own supplemental references to the credential, true by default.
        + evidence_items (array, optional) - Evidence to add to this credential, that provide more information about how the recipient met the achievement. See http://docs.accrediblecredentialapi.apiary.io/#reference/evidence-items/evidence-item/create-a-new-evidence-item for fields. Typically this would include work samples for a course.
        + references (array, optional) - References to add to this Credential, that provide more information about how the recipient met the achievement. see http://docs.accrediblecredentialapi.apiary.io/#reference/references/reference/create-a-new-reference for fields. Typically this would be a peer, teacher or manager giving their feedback.

# Group Groups
Groups are similar to a course or a folder of Credentials. They contain information about the achievement and have multiple Credentials attached to them.

For example you should create a group for the Introduction to Programming course. You'd provide the Course Name, Course Descripion and Course URL. In the future you can pass the name or ID of this group when creating a credential so that the credential is passed all the information relating to the achievement.

# Group Designs

## Designs [/v1/issuer/all_designs]
Designs provide a visual specification for how a Credential should be rendered. Design can be used accross multiple Groups.

For example if we have three courses: Intro to Basic Programming, Intro to Advanced Programming and Intro to DevOps each of these may have the same design for their Credentials. When creating or updating their corresponding Groups you would attach the desired design accordingly.
